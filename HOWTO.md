## How to compile and run the code ##

Prerequisites:
- Newer Delphi compiler - 10.4 or later - Community Editions will do.
- An installation of the re-released game - either from Steam or GOG - and it is often on sale.
    + Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/1558990/Siege_of_Avalon_Anthology/
    + GOG: https://www.gog.com/en/game/siege_of_avalon_anthology

Clone or download the repo, and copy all files from your game installation into the `soa-resources` folder

In the Delphi IDE open the `src\win32\Siege.dpr`

Build/Compile - Enjoy
